""" 
Necklace numbers are a number sequence.  You start with 2 digits. The 3rd digit is created by adding the previous 2 digits, but if it's greater than 10, you add the sum of those 2 digits again.  You keep repeating this process until you get back to the 2 digits you started with

extra: What is the shortest necklace number sequence that can be made?
